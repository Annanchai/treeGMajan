            <h2>Cataract</h2>
            <p>Cataract is one of the most common eye diseases which is whitening of transparent lens. It leads to blurring of vision eventually losing the vision.</p>
            <h4>Treatment of cataract:</h4>
            <p>Cataract surgery is the only treatment available, by which the opaque lens is replaced by new artificial intra ocular lenses.</p>
            <h4>Phaco emulsification (Pin Hole Surgery):</h4>
            <p>It’s the latest and simple method of cataract surgery. Phaco emulsification is a procedure by which cataract is broken into small pieces and removed from the eye using ultrasound with the help of special Phaco equipment.</p>
            <h4>SICS (Key Hole Surgery):</h4>
            <p>In this process make a wound about 4-6 mm and remove cataract use of micro instruments.</p>
            <h4>Why Us?</h4>
            <p>At treeG Mayan Eye Centre we perform most advanced Phaco machine (Alcon Centurion Vision System) Surgical technology safe and best-in-class. We offered different type of Cataract surgery packages lower to premium that can utilize all kinds of people.</p>
            <p>Regular Phaco emulsification with 2.8 mm and Micro Phaco emulsification 2.2 mm also available.</p>
            <h2>Glaucoma</h2>
            <p>Glaucoma is a family of more than 30 diseases that affects pressure within the eye, damaging the optic nerve . When pressure inside the eye increases, blind spots in peripheral areas of vision may occur . Of all conditions and diseases of the eye, glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness in the world . Often called the “sneak thief” of sight, most forms of glaucoma do not produce symptoms until vision is already severely damaged . But if diagnosed early, the disease can be controlled and permanent vision loss can be prevented.</p>
            <h3>Glaucoma Laser Surgeries</h3>
            <h4>Trabeculectomy:</h4>
            <p>It is a surgical procedure used in the treatment of glaucoma to relieve intraocular pressure by removing part of the eye’s trabecular meshwork and adjacent structures . Trabeculectomy—sometimes also called filtration surgery—a piece of tissue in the drainage angle of the eye is removed, creating an opening . The opening is partially covered with a flap of tissue from the sclera, the white part of the eye, and the conjunctiva, the clear thin covering over the sclera .</p>
            <h4>Iridotomy: </h4>
            <p>An iridotomy involves making puncture-like openings through the iris without the removal of iris tissue . Performed either with standard surgical instruments or a laser, it is typically used to decrease intraocular pressure in patients with angle-closure glaucoma . A laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) is the application of a laser beam to selectively burn a hole through the iris near its base .</p>
            <h4>Iridectomy:</h4>
            <p>An iridectomy is a procedure in eye surgery in which the surgeon removes a small, full-thickness piece of the iris, which is the colored circular membrane behind the cornea of the eye . Treat closed-angle glaucoma after the pressure in the affected eye has been reduced with medicine or when medicines fail . Prevent closed-angle glaucoma in people who have narrow drainage angles and those people who have had closed-angle glaucoma in their other eye.</p>
            <h4>Implant Surgery: </h4>
            <p>The term “glaucoma implants” sometimes is used to describe shunts and stents, but also describes tiny devices implanted in the eye that are designed to provide a sustained release of glaucoma medicine to reduce eye pressure .</p>
            <h4>Tube Shunt Surgery: </h4>
            <p>Tube-shunt surgery involves placing a flexible plastic tube with an attached silicone drainage pouch in the eye to help drain fluid (aqueous humor) from the eye. This type of surgery is usually done after a trabeculectomy that failed.</p>
            <h2>Pediatric Opthalmology</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Amblyopia or Lazy Eye</li>
                <li>Pediatric Glaucoma</li>
                <li>Strabismus</li>
                <li>Retinopathy of Prematurity</li>
                <li>Retinoblastoma</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Pediatric ophthalmology is a subspecialty of ophthalmology dealing with children’s eye diseases. The human visual system develops as the brain matures, a process that takes about ten years. Although a baby’s eyes are optically capable of seeing, infant vision is limited to around 20/1500, in part because the brain has not learned how to process the visual messages it receives. As visual development proceeds, that same child will eventually be able to detect the finest details in an image. Some children or infants have visual disorders that are secondary to serious diseases in their brain or nervous system. At treeG Majan Eye Centre, these children receive the attention of a pediatric ophthalmologist who specializes in visual problems related to brain disorders. Vision problems include cortical blindness, delayed visual maturation, optic nerve hypoplasia, optic nerve atrophy and cranial neuropathies.</p>
            <h4>Why Us</h4>
            <p>The pediatric glaucoma specialists at treeG Majan Eye Centre manage all forms of glaucoma in children. A wide range of medical and surgical options are available to treat infants and children with these disorders. Most patients require surgery which can include trabeculotomy or goniotomy.</p>
            <h2>Squint Clinic</h2>
            <p>Squint or Strabismus is a condition in which the eyes do not properly align with each other while looking at an object. Strabismus occurs in about 2% of children. An instrument called Synoptophore is used to measure the squint and also to give exercise for the eyes.</p>
            <h4>Treatment:</h4>
            <p>Treatment depends on the type of strabismus and the underlying cause. This may include the use of glasses, occlussion therapy, Haidinger brush exercise in synoptophore and possibly surgery. Some types benefit from early surgery.</p>
            <h4>Why Us</h4>
            <p>At treeG Majan Eye Centre we’ve separate squint clinic where we’ve different packages to work on the different cases. The specialist give various excersies and traning sessions for the patients.</p>
            <h2>Retina</h2>
            <h4>Diabetic Retinopathy:</h4>
            <p>Diabetic retinopathy is one of the complications of diabetes mellitus. This disease occurs due to damaged blood vessels in the light-sensitive tissues at the back of the eye (retina). It’s always recommended for the diabetic patients to consult an eye doctor. You cannot always prevent diabetic retinopathy. However, regular retinal screening, blood sugar regulation, blood pressure and early intervention to resolve vision problems can help prevent severe loss of vision.</p>
            <h4>RETINAL DETACHMENT:</h4>
            <p>Retinal detachment is a separation of the light-sensitive membrane in the back of the eye (the retina) from its supporting layers.</p>
            <h4>Why Us?</h4>
            <p>Tests will be done to check the retina and pupil response and your ability to see colors properly. These may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Intraocular pressure determination</li>
                <li> Ophthalmoscopy</li>
                <li>Refraction test</li>
                <li>Retinal photography</li>
                <li>Test to determine your ability to see colors properly (color defectiveness)</li>
                <li>Visual acuity</li>
                <li>Slit-lamp examination</li>
                <li>Ultrasound of the eye</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Retinopathy of Prematurity:</h4>
            <h5>Alternative Names: Retrolental fibroplasia; ROP</h5>
             <p>Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is abnormal blood vessel development in the retina of the eye in a premature infant</p>
